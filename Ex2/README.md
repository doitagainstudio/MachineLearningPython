# **COURSERA MACHINE LEARNING** #
## *Python Edition* ## 
## *Ex.2 - Logistic Regression* ##
***A Jupyter Notebook by Cristiano Esposito Â©2021***

<p>Following the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera, here is the Week 2 assignment coded in Python instead of Octave.
<p>We'll use the Logistic Regression algorithms to resolve a classification problem and so first train a model and then make some predictions and verify accurancy of our model.
<p>The excercise has been divided in two notebooks:
    <li>the first one, named Ex2_part1, shows a Classification problem where data about exam results will be used to train a model with Logistic Regression algorithm and then the same model will be use to predict the probability of an admission for a new student, being provided new exams results;</li>
    <li>the second one, named Ex2_part2, will use the Regularized Logistic Regression algorithm to train a model which initial data, about some microchip testings, are not linearly separated. Then the accurancy of the model will be verified.</li>
<p>Hope you'll enjoy and don't forget to check also for the other weeks assigments rewritten in Python here on my GitHub space.
