# **COURSERA MACHINE LEARNING** #
## *Python Edition* ## 
## *Ex.2_part1 - Linear Regression* ##
***A Jupyter Notebook by Cristiano Esposito Â©2021***

<p>Following the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera, here is the Week 2 assignment coded in Python instead of Octave.
<p>We'll use the Logistic Regression algorithms to resolve a classification problem and so first train a model using exam result scores and then to predict probability for a student with a certain score to be admitted or not. 
<p>In the first part of the notebook, data will be loaded from an external file (the same provided in week 2 folder from the Coursera site) and then wrangled into arrays for the proper model creation using Python and Numpy library.
<p>In the second part, the user will be asked to input some new variables to predict probability of admission.
<p>Hope you'll enjoy and don't forget to check also for the other weeks assigments rewritten in Python here on my GitHub space.
